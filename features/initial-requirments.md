We are building a python package similar to Faker but with focus on providing telecom operator information to generate test data.

The package should be able to generate data for the following:
- Operators and the countries they operate in
- Information about their size
- Numbering information like Prefix, MCC, MNC, etc.

The library should provide a random operator with available information.
Ideally we use realistic data from real operators.
Perform a research if there is a global list or database of operators and their information available for use.
